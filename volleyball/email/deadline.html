                    <h1>Hi Everyone,</h1>
                    <p>Volleyball season is fast approaching, and we simply want to remind you that ALL final team payments are required by April 21, 2016, through our online volleyball link (See below).</p>
                    <p>If you and/or your teammates have yet to pay, please ensure to submit payment before the deadline, to avoid forfeiting your team 's position in this year's volleyball season.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #d34426;"><strong>* FINAL PAYMENT DEADLINE IS APRIL 21, 2016 *</strong></h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center; color: #d34426;">&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2>To Submit Your Payment as a Team Member</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>If you are a player who hasn't yet paid, you can <a href="http://www.johnmax.ca/volleyball/pay/index.php?payamount=[payamount]&eid=[email]&name=[fullname]&teamid=[teamid]&playerid=[playerid]">Click here</a> to submit your payment.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <h2>To Pay Remaining Team Balance (Team Captain Only)</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>If you are a Team Captain who has made other payment arrangements with your teammates, and would like to pay the remaining balance of your team yourself, you can do so by <a href="http://www.johnmax.ca/volleyball/check-status.php?teamid=[teamid]&amp;emailid=[email]">Clicking here</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Q. What if I would like to adjust the number of teammates I have on my roster?</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>A.</strong> When you created your team, you were required to specify the number of teammates you'd like on your team. The application automatically generated the &quot;Fee per Person&quot; amount. At this time, this cannot be modified, so you will simply need to have the initial teammates pay the original fees, and sort the difference out among yourselves. We're making enhancements to the application, to provide more flexibility in the future, however for now, this is the easiest workaround.<br />
                        <br />
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Q. I'm the Team Captain, can I simply pay the balance myself?</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>A.</strong> Yes, as the Team Captain, you can pay the remaining balance of your team, if you prefer to manually collect payment from your teammates yourself. All Team Captain's will be reminded of any outstanding balances, before April 21st's deadline, to ensure payments can be submitted.<br />
                        <br />
                        If you are the Team Captain, you can pay your balance by <a href="http://www.johnmax.ca/volleyball/check-status.php?teamid=[teamid]&emailid=[email]">clicking here</a>. </li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>If you have any further questions regarding the registration/roster process, there is a &quot;Need Help?&quot; link located in the top right hand corner of the registration application, that will allow you to get in touch with us, with any of your questions/concerns.</p>
                    <p>We look forward to the upcoming season, and of course, the nice weather!</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your business,</p>
                    <p>John Max Sports &amp; Wings</p>
